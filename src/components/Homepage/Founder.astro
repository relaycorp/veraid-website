          I designed VeraId to provide users of Letro, a secure alternative to email, with
          offline-compatible user identifiers robust enough to withstand attacks by nation-state
          actors.

          VeraId evolved into its own project as its potential became clear. Its capacity for
          attributing content to user-friendly, customisable, decentralised user identifiers can
          enhance existing systems and pave the way for a new generation of decentralised apps like <a
            href="https://letro.io"
            class="text-green-400">Letro</a
          >.
