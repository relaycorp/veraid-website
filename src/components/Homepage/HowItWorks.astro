      <p>
        VeraId combines DNSSEC with a new Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to produce digital
        signatures that can be linked to a domain name. Consequently, every signature contains
        enough data to be independently verified without external queries, such as DNS lookups.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, this is how we'd verify a <em>VeraId Signature Bundle</em> attributing "Bazinga!"
        to <code>sheldon@caltech.edu</code>:

      <p>
        Any DNSSEC-enabled domain can be a trust anchor in the PKI, but it only has control over
        itself. This offers far better security than PKIs such as the Transport Layer Security
        (TLS), where many trust anchors (Certificate Authorities) can issue certificates for any
        domain.
