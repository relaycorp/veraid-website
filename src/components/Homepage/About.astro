      This project is led by <a href="https://relaycorp.io" class="text-green-400">Relaycorp</a> and
      funded by the <a href="https://www.opentechfund.org/" class="text-green-400"
        >Open Technology Fund</a
      > for use in <a href="https://letro.io" class="text-green-400">Letro</a>, but VeraId itself is
      completely agnostic of Letro and Relaycorp.
    </p>

    <p>
      We could've bundled it with Letro, but the core functionality is generic enough and so widely
      applicable that it makes more sense to develop it independently. We also expect it to play a
      crucial role in <a href="https://awala.org" class="text-green-400">Awala</a> in the future, such
      as when we support <a
        href="https://awala.org/docs/concepts/message-broadcasting/"
        class="text-green-400">message broadcasting</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      The word vera is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera" class="text-green-400">Ido</a> for
      authentic, and it's pronounced VEH-rah (with a trilled R).
