# About VeraId

VeraId is led by [Relaycorp](https://relaycorp.tech/), a company on a mission to tackle the most pressing and neglected communication problems. We built VeraId initially to support our offline email alternative, [Letro](https://letro.app/en/), thanks to funding from the [Open Technology Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/projects-we-support/supported-projects/awala/).

The word _vera_ is [Ido](https://www.idolinguo.org.uk/general.htm) for _authentic_, and it's pronounced VEH-rah (with a trilled R).
