# VeraId services

VeraId itself is a generic protocol, meant to be integrated in a broader protocol known as a _service_.

As of this writing, [Letro](https://letro.app/en/) is the only VeraId service.
You can learn more about its VeraId integration in the documentation for [Letro Server](https://docs.relaycorp.tech/letro-server/).

We're also working on a service to leverage VeraId to bring service accounts to the Internet,
allowing clients to authenticate by proving their identity (e.g. `alice@example.com`) rather than using API keys.
Think AWS roles or Azure managed identities, but for the entire Internet.
Stay tuned!
