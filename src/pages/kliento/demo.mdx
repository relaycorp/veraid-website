# Test Drive Kliento

This hands-on guide demonstrates how to set up a complete Kliento authentication system locally. You'll build both client and server components, configure your domain, obtain token bundles, and make authenticated requests between them—all on your own computer. Since Kliento is a small extension to the [VeraId protocol](/), most of this exercise involves setting up [VeraId Authority](https://docs.relaycorp.tech/veraid-authority/) to issue the necessary credentials.

We'll demonstrate how clients can leverage existing workload identities (like those from GitHub Actions or GCP service accounts) to obtain VeraId credentials. Whilst [VeraId Authority is technically optional](/kliento/clients/#without-veraid-authority)—clients could use long-lived private keys to sign credentials directly—using VeraId Authority simplifies credential management and is the recommended approach for workload authentication.

**For educational purposes, we use low-level tools like `curl` rather than our existing high-level tooling** to help you understand what's happening. This, coupled with the fact that we'll be implementing both client and server sides simultaneously, makes this walkthrough appear more complex than a typical Kliento integration would be in production.

If you get stuck at any point, please post a question on the [r/VeraId](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeraId/) Reddit sub.

## Prerequisites

- A domain name you control.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- [Curl](https://curl.se/download.html).
- [`jq`](https://jqlang.org/download/).

Please note that the commands in this tutorial have been tested on Linux and macOS. If you're using Windows, you'll need to adjust the commands accordingly (e.g. use `curl.exe` instead of `curl`).

Lastly, we'll be creating new files, which you may want to do in a new temporary directory.

## 1. Enable DNSSEC on your domain

Skip this step if you're using a domain name that is already DNSSEC-enabled.

If your DNS hosting provider is the same as your registrar, the process may be as straightforward as ticking a box to enable DNSSEC. Otherwise, you'll have to copy the DNSSEC configuration from your DNS hosting provider (e.g. Cloudflare) to your registrar (e.g. GoDaddy). Either way, the process is entirely provider-specific, so we recommend you consult the relevant documentation if it isn't obvious.

You can use [DNSSEC Analyzer](https://dnssec-analyzer.verisignlabs.com/) to verify that your domain is correctly configured. Since it may take a few minutes for the DNS changes to propagate, you may want to continue with the rest of the guide and check back later.

## 2. Implement the server

We'll implement a trivial Hono server that verifies Kliento token bundles and outputs the identifier of the client, as well as the claims in the token.

Save the following code in a file called `server.js`:

```js
import { serve } from "@hono/node-server";
import { TokenBundle } from "@veraid/kliento";
import { Hono } from "hono";

const app = new Hono().get("/", async (context) => {
  const audience = context.req.url;

  const authHeader = context.req.header("Authorization");
  const tokenBundle = TokenBundle.deserialiseFromAuthHeader(authHeader);
  const result = await tokenBundle.verify(audience);
  return context.json(result);
});

serve({ fetch: app.fetch, port: 3000 });
```

The server above exposes a `GET /` endpoint that accepts an `Authorization` header with a Kliento token bundle, and requires the `audience` to be set to the URL of the request.

Next, create the `package.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
  "name": "kliento-server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": {
    "@hono/node-server": "^1.14.1",
    "@veraid/kliento-verifier": "^1.0.3"
  }
}
```

We're going to deploy it in a Docker container, so create the `Dockerfile` file with the following content:

```dockerfile
FROM node:22.14.0-slim
WORKDIR /opt/kliento-server
COPY . ./
RUN npm install
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
EXPOSE 3000
```

We'll deploy this server in the next step when we also deploy VeraId Authority.

## 3. Deploy VeraId Authority

You're going to use Docker Compose to deploy a local instance of VeraId Authority, along with its backing services (e.g. MongoDB), and a mock OAuth2 server, to emulate a third-party identity provider like GCP (`https://accounts.google.com`).

![Kliento setup diagram](/diagrams/kliento/demo-diagram.svg)

In an eventual production deployment, you may actually prefer to use our upcoming VeraId Authority-as-a-Service offering or deploy a serverless infrastructure with an official Terraform module (e.g. [`relaycorp/veraid-authority/google`](https://github.com/relaycorp/terraform-google-veraid-authority) for GCP).

Create a `compose.yml` file with the following content to deploy VeraId Authority and its backing services, using this opportunity to also deploy the server we implemented in the previous step:

```yaml
services:
  kliento-server:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8082:3000"

  veraid-authority:
    image: ghcr.io/relaycorp/veraid-authority:2.5.0
    command: api
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8080:8080"
    environment:
      AUTHORITY_VERSION: "1.0.0dev1"
      AUTHORITY_SUPERADMIN: admin@veraid.example
      MONGODB_URI: mongodb://mongodb/?authSource=admin
      MONGODB_USER: root
      MONGODB_PASSWORD: password123
      MONGODB_DB: endpoint
      OAUTH2_JWKS_URL: http://mock-authz-server:8080/default/jwks
      OAUTH2_TOKEN_AUDIENCE: default
      OAUTH2_TOKEN_ISSUER_REGEX: "^http://[^/]+/default$$"
      KMS_ADAPTER: AWS
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: access_key_id
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: secret_access_key
      AWS_KMS_ENDPOINT: http://mock-aws-kms:8080
      AWS_KMS_REGION: eu-west-2
    depends_on:
      mongodb:
        condition: service_healthy
      mock-authz-server:
        condition: service_started
      mock-aws-kms:
        condition: service_healthy

  mock-authz-server:
    image: ghcr.io/navikt/mock-oauth2-server:2.1.10
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8081:8080"
    environment:
      JSON_CONFIG: |
        {
          "tokenCallbacks": [
            {
              "issuerId": "default",
              "tokenExpiry": 3600,
              "requestMappings": [
                {
                  "requestParam": "client_id",
                  "match": "super-admin",
                  "claims": {"email": "admin@veraid.example"}
                },
                {
                  "requestParam": "client_id",
                  "match": "workload",
                  "claims": {
                    "email": "machine@cloud-provider.example",
                    "aud": "$${audience}"
                  }
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }

  mock-aws-kms:
    image: nsmithuk/local-kms:3.11.4
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "sh", "-c", "netstat -an | grep -q ':8080.*LISTEN' || nc -z localhost 8080"]
      interval: 5s
      retries: 3

  mongodb:
    image: mongo:8.0.6
    command: "--quiet"
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: password123
    volumes:
      - mongodb-data:/data/db
    healthcheck:
      test: echo 'db.runCommand("ping").ok' | mongosh localhost:27017/test --quiet
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 40s

volumes:
  mongodb-data:
```

Then start the services:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

At this point, you will have deployed the following services locally:

- `veraid-authority`: The VeraId Authority server, accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
- `mock-authz-server`: A mock OAuth2 server, accessible at `http://localhost:8081`.
- `mock-aws-kms`: A server that emulates AWS KMS. You can use any Key Management Service supported by [`@relaycorp/webcrypto-kms`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@relaycorp/webcrypto-kms).
- `mongodb`: A MongoDB server.
- `kliento-server`: The trivial Hono server we implemented previously, accessible at `http://localhost:8082`. Note that although we're deploying this server in the same Docker Compose project as the other services, it does not depend on any of them.

## 4. Log in as super-admin

We configured VeraId Authority to use `admin@veraid.example` as the super-admin, so we need to obtain a JWT from our mock OAuth2 server to assume that role on the VeraId Authority API by running the following command:

```bash
export SUPER_ADMIN_TOKEN=$(curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8081/default/token \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data-urlencode grant_type=client_credentials \
  --data-urlencode client_id=super-admin \
  --data-urlencode client_secret=s3cr3t \
  --silent \
  | jq -r .access_token)
```

Double-check that you obtained a JWT by printing the token with `echo $SUPER_ADMIN_TOKEN`. You should see a base64-encoded string beginning with `ey`.

We'll act as super-admin when interacting with the VeraId Authority API for the rest of the document, but in production you'll want to observe the principle of least privilege and [use a different role](https://docs.relaycorp.tech/veraid-authority/api#authentication-and-authorisation).

## 5. Configure your domain name

Now it's time to create an _organisation_ for your domain name. In VeraId, domain names participating in the protocol are called "organisations".

To simplify the rest of the exercise, let's store your organisation name in an environment variable:

```bash
export ORG_NAME=example.com
```

Then run the following command to create the organisation:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8080/orgs \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $SUPER_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data "{\"name\": \"$ORG_NAME\"}" \
  --silent \
  | jq -r .txtRecordRdata
```

You should now create a TXT record under the `_veraid` subdomain of your domain name (`_veraid.$ORG_NAME`), setting its value to the output of the command above. The TXT record value will look like this:

```
1 XRSDmxhlZhYx+Y8dUy0LWd+Oinp6l6GZsk9gnZpd8S0= 3600
```

In this example, `1` denotes the key algorithm (RSA), `XRSDmxhlZhYx+Y8dUy0LWd+Oinp6l6GZsk9gnZpd8S0=` is the base64-encoded public key, and `3600` is the _VeraId TTL override_ (in seconds). You may adjust the TTL depending on your needs.

## 6. Configure the VeraId member

VeraId signatures are attributed to _members_ of the organisation, and there are two types of members: _bots_, which act on behalf of the organisation (e.g. `example.com`), and _users_, which act on their own behalf (e.g. `alice@example.com`). The only difference is that users have names and bots don't.

Run the following command to create a new user named `alice`, but feel free to replace `alice` with any name you like or remove the name altogether if you're creating a bot:

```bash
export MEMBER_SIGNATURE_SPECS_ENDPOINT=$(curl --request POST \
  --url "http://localhost:8080/orgs/$ORG_NAME/members" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $SUPER_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"name": "alice", "role": "REGULAR"}' \
  --silent \
  | jq -r .signatureSpecs)
```

The command above will output the endpoint of the member's signature specs (e.g. `/orgs/$ORG_NAME/members/{memberId}/signature-specs`), which you'll use in the next step.

## 7. Configure the signature spec

Clients need to obtain a Kliento token bundle, which is a form of _VeraId signature bundle_ where the payload is a JSON object with the attributes `audience` (a string identifying the server where the token bundle will be valid) and `claims` (an optional object of key/value pairs). It's up to the server to define which claims are supported and how they're used.

To get VeraId Authority to issue signature bundles for the desired payload, you'll have to create a _signature spec_ for the member created in the previous step. Before creating the signature spec, let's define the payload and base64-encode it:

```bash
export KLIENTO_TOKEN='{"audience": "http://localhost:8082/"}'

# On Windows, use an online encoder like https://www.base64decode.org
export KLIENTO_TOKEN_BASE64=$(echo "$KLIENTO_TOKEN" | base64)
```

Once the base64-encoded Kliento token is stored in the `KLIENTO_TOKEN_BASE64` environment variable, you can create the signature spec by making a POST request to the member's signature specs endpoint obtained in the previous step:

```bash
export SIGNATURE_SPEC=$(cat << EOF
{
  "auth": {
    "type": "oidc-discovery",
    "providerIssuerUrl": "http://mock-authz-server:8080/default",
    "jwtSubjectClaim": "email",
    "jwtSubjectValue": "machine@cloud-provider.example"
  },
  "serviceOid": "1.3.6.1.4.1.58708.3.0",
  "ttlSeconds": 600,
  "plaintext": "${KLIENTO_TOKEN_BASE64}"
}
EOF
)
export EXCHANGE_URL=$(curl --request POST \
  --url "http://localhost:8080${MEMBER_SIGNATURE_SPECS_ENDPOINT}" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $SUPER_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data "$SIGNATURE_SPEC" \
  --silent \
  | jq -r .exchangeUrl)
```

Where the signature spec is defined as follows:

- `auth` requires the client to present a JWT from the mock OAuth2 server and the claim `email` set to `machine@cloud-provider.example`.
- `serviceOid` binds the signature bundles to Kliento (OID `1.3.6.1.4.1.58708.3.0`), so they can't be used in a different context.
- `ttlSeconds` caps the validity of the signature bundles at 10 minutes (600 seconds).
- `plaintext` is the base64-encoded Kliento token (`$KLIENTO_TOKEN_BASE64`).

The output of the command above (`$EXCHANGE_URL`) is the URL that the client will use to exchange its JWTs for the signature bundles we configured to represent Kliento token bundles.

## 8. Test it!

We'll use `curl` as our client to demonstrate how to obtain token bundles and use them to make authenticated requests to the server.

First, obtain a JWT from the mock OAuth2 server:

```bash
export EXCHANGE_JWT=$(curl --request POST \
  --url "http://localhost:8081/default/token" \
  --header "Host: mock-authz-server:8080" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data-urlencode grant_type=client_credentials \
  --data-urlencode client_id=workload \
  --data-urlencode client_secret=s3cr3t \
  --data-urlencode "audience=$EXCHANGE_URL" \
  --silent \
  | jq -r .access_token)
```

Then exchange the JWT for a token bundle:

```bash
export TOKEN_BUNDLE="$(curl \
  --url "$EXCHANGE_URL" \
  --header 'Accept: application/vnd.veraid.signature-bundle+base64' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $EXCHANGE_JWT")"
```

And finally, make a request to the server using the token bundle:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url "http://localhost:8082/" \
  --header "Authorization: Kliento $TOKEN_BUNDLE"
```

The response should report the client's identifier: `user@your-domain.com` or simply `your-domain.com` if you created a bot.

Remember that you set the signature spec to expire in 10 minutes, so you can reuse the token bundle as many times as you like within that time frame.

## That's a wrap!

Congratulations! You've successfully set up a complete Kliento system on your local machine. You've deployed a local VeraId Authority instance, implemented a server that validates token bundles, created domain-based identities, and demonstrated the full authentication flow from JWT exchange to making authenticated requests.

To clean up:

1. Stop the Docker Compose process with `Ctrl+C`/`Cmd+C`.
2. Remove the Docker resources:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down --volumes --rmi all
   ```
3. Delete the files we created:
   ```bash
   rm compose.yml server.js package.json Dockerfile
   ```
